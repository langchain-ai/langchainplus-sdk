I have no idea what fw version it is likely to have - all I know is that its brand new, white and 32gig.\n\nI took the plunge from my Desire HD so fingers crossed I will be happy with my decision to change!\n\nThanks again for your post...\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nNov 30, 2011\n#3\nNo problem. :) Glad it was a help. Thought it should be posted in his forum as well as the same method that worked for the SGS1 works for the SGS2.\nCongrats on the purchase. You'll love the phone. Have had mine for a few weeks and it's been great.\nmarcyspark\nSenior Member\nNov 30, 2011\n#4\nI have spend many hours going through XDA dev forums to prepare for the arrival of the SGS2 and I am still trying to work out what ROM to go for.\n\nI recently moved to MIUI on the Desire HD and am really enjoying the difference between this and the HTC Sense bloat. I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "content_type": null, "lastmod": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "e8d44c58-bd71-5fe5-ba58-6ea6bade7496"}, "page_content": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# AINetwork Toolkit\n\n[AI Network](https://www.ainetwork.ai/build-on-ain) is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the [$AIN token](https://www.ainetwork.ai/token), enriching AI-driven `NFTs` (`AINFTs`).\n\nThe `AINetwork Toolkit` is a set of tools for interacting with the [AINetwork Blockchain](https://www.ainetwork.ai/public/whitepaper.pdf). These tools allow you to transfer `AIN`, read and write values, create apps, and set permissions for specific paths within the blockchain database.\n\n## Installing dependencies\u200b\n\nBefore using the AINetwork Toolkit, you need to install the ain-py package.

This can be helpful when giving them access to tools. Often in these situations you may want to edit the graph state before continuing (for example, to edit what tool is being called, or how it is being called).\nThis can be in several ways, but the primary supported way is to add an \"interrupt\" before a node is executed. This interrupts execution at that node. You can then use update_state to update the state, and then resume from that spot to continue.\nSetup\u00b6\nWe are not going to show the full code for the graph we are hosting, but you can see it here if you want to.

And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI.

We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.\n\nWe will cover:\n\n- How the dialect of the LangChain [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) impacts the prompt of the chain;\n\n- How to format schema information into the prompt using `SQLDatabase.get_context`;\n\n- How to build and select [few-shot examples](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/) to assist the model.\n\n## Setup\u200b\n\nFirst, get required packages and set environment variables:\n\n```python\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\n# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.\n# import os\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n```\n\nThe below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}]}

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

Thought it should be posted in his forum as well as the same method that worked for the SGS1 works for the SGS2.\nCongrats on the purchase. You'll love the phone.

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due", "type": "Document"}], "steps": ["If the command still fails, consider using a different method to check the network lock status, such as using a terminal emulator app directly on the device."]}

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

I have no idea what fw version it is likely to have - all I know is that its brand new, white and 32gig.\n\nI took the plunge from my Desire HD so fingers crossed I will be happy with my decision to change!\n\nThanks again for your post...\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nNov 30, 2011\n#3\nNo problem. :) Glad it was a help. Thought it should be posted in his forum as well as the same method that worked for the SGS1 works for the SGS2.\nCongrats on the purchase. You'll love the phone. Have had mine for a few weeks and it's been great.\nmarcyspark\nSenior Member\nNov 30, 2011\n#4\nI have spend many hours going through XDA dev forums to prepare for the arrival of the SGS2 and I am still trying to work out what ROM to go for.\n\nI recently moved to MIUI on the Desire HD and am really enjoying the difference between this and the HTC Sense bloat. I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI.

Not required.\n# import os\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n```\n\nThe below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

the Status of your Threads\n\nCheck the Status of your Threads\u00b6\nSetup\u00b6\nTo start, we can setup our client with whatever URL you are hosting your graph from:\nSDK initialization\u00b6\nFirst, we need to setup our client so that we can communicate with our hosted graph:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nfrom langgraph_sdk import get_client\nclient = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)\n# Using the graph deployed with the name \"agent\"\nassistant_id = \"agent\"\nthread = await client.threads.create()\n\nimport { Client } from

client.threads.create();\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{}'\n\nFind idle threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that are idle, which means that all runs executed on the thread have finished running:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"idle\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"idle\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search

threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that have been interrupted in the middle of a run, which could either mean an error occurred before the run finished or a human-in-the-loop breakpoint was reached and the run is waiting to continue: \nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"interrupted\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await

find threads that are busy, meaning they are currently handling the execution of a run:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"busy\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"busy\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"status\":

specific threads, which you can do in a few ways:\nFind by ID\u00b6\nYou can use the get function to find the status of a specific thread, as long as you have the ID saved\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>))['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>)).status);\n\ncurl --request GET \\ \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/<THREAD_ID> \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq -r '.status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nFind by metadata\u00b6\nThe search endpoint for threads also allows you to filter on metadata, which can be helpful if you use metadata to tag threads in order to keep them organized:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);", "type": "Document"},

This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself.

Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.

I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"}]}

I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet.

the Status of your Threads\n\nCheck the Status of your Threads\u00b6\nSetup\u00b6\nTo start, we can setup our client with whatever URL you are hosting your graph from:\nSDK initialization\u00b6\nFirst, we need to setup our client so that we can communicate with our hosted graph:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nfrom langgraph_sdk import get_client\nclient = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)\n# Using the graph deployed with the name \"agent\"\nassistant_id = \"agent\"\nthread = await client.threads.create()\n\nimport { Client } from \"@langchain/langgraph-sdk\";\n\nconst client = new Client({ apiUrl: <DEPLOYMENT_URL> });\n// Using the graph deployed with the name \"agent\"\nconst assistantId = \"agent\";\nconst thread = await client.threads.create();\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{}'\n\nFind idle threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that are idle, which means that all runs executed on the thread have finished running:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"idle\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"idle\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search

threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that have been interrupted in the middle of a run, which could either mean an error occurred before the run finished or a human-in-the-loop breakpoint was reached and the run is waiting to continue: \nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"interrupted\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"interrupted\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"status\":

find threads that are busy, meaning they are currently handling the execution of a run:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"busy\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"busy\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"status\":

specific threads, which you can do in a few ways:\nFind by ID\u00b6\nYou can use the get function to find the status of a specific thread, as long as you have the ID saved\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>))['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>)).status);\n\ncurl --request GET \\ \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/<THREAD_ID> \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq -r '.status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nFind by metadata\u00b6\nThe search endpoint for threads also allows you to filter on metadata, which can be helpful if you use metadata to tag threads in order to keep them organized:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);", "type": "Document"},

I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "iFixit is the largest, open repair community on the web.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"},

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due", "type":

get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)\n# Using the graph deployed with the name \"agent\"\nassistant_id = \"agent\"\nthread = await client.threads.create()\n\nimport { Client } from

client.threads.create();\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{}'\n\nFind idle threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that are idle, which means that all runs executed on the thread have finished running:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"idle\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"idle\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search

threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that have been interrupted in the middle of a run, which could either mean an error occurred before the run finished or a human-in-the-loop breakpoint was reached and the run is waiting to continue: \nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"interrupted\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await

specific threads, which you can do in a few ways:\nFind by ID\u00b6\nYou can use the get function to find the status of a specific thread, as long as you have the ID saved\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>))['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>)).status);\n\ncurl --request GET \\ \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/<THREAD_ID> \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq -r '.status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nFind by metadata\u00b6\nThe search endpoint for threads also allows you to filter on metadata, which can be helpful if you use metadata to tag threads in order to keep them organized:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);", "type": "Document"},

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"}], "answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due", "type":

client.threads.create();\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{}'\n\nFind idle threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that are idle, which means that all runs executed on the thread have finished running:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"idle\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"idle\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search

threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that have been interrupted in the middle of a run, which could either mean an error occurred before the run finished or a human-in-the-loop breakpoint was reached and the run is waiting to continue: \nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"interrupted\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await

specific threads, which you can do in a few ways:\nFind by ID\u00b6\nYou can use the get function to find the status of a specific thread, as long as you have the ID saved\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>))['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>)).status);\n\ncurl --request GET \\ \n--url

filter on metadata, which can be helpful if you use metadata to tag threads in order to keep them organized:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);", "type": "Document"},

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"}], "answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential\n</document>\n<document  description='AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' title='AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' uuid='81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb'>\n### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```\n</document>\n<document  description='Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' title='Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' uuid='2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755'>\nShell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.

I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due\n</document>\n<document  description='' language='' changefreq=None source='https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/check_thread_status/' title='Check the Status of your Threads | \ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd78\ufe0fLangGraph' content_type=None lastmod='2024-12-03' priority=None loc='https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/check_thread_status/' uuid='30f5d5a1-be8a-57c3-86b0-1bad95f6932a'>\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"metadata\": {\"foo\":\"bar\"}, \"limit\": 1}' | jq -r '.[0].status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nComments\n</document>\n</documents>\n<context/>", "type": "system"}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "HumanMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "how to do this ?\nXDA Forums\nHome\nForums\nDevices\nGuides\nWhat's new\nLog in\nRegister\nNew posts\n \nManufacturers\n \nWhat's new\n \nMembers\nTopics\n3D Printing\nAndroid Auto\nAndroid Mods\nAndroid TV\nApps & Games\nThemes\nWear OS\nSmartwatches\nWindows 11\nXDA Computing\nTerms and rules Privacy Security\n[HOWTO] [root required] Remove network lock using nv_data.bin\n Thread starterdavidheffernan  Start dateNov 30, 2011\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\n1\n2\nNext\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nNov 30, 2011\n#1\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due", "type":

initialization\u00b6\nFirst, we need to setup our client so that we can communicate with our hosted graph:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nfrom langgraph_sdk import get_client\nclient = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)\n# Using the graph deployed with the name \"agent\"\nassistant_id = \"agent\"\nthread = await client.threads.create()\n\nimport { Client } from

client.threads.create();\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{}'\n\nFind idle threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that are idle, which means that all runs executed on the thread have finished running:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"idle\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await client.threads.search({ status: \"idle\", limit: 1 }));\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search

threads\u00b6\nWe can use the following commands to find threads that have been interrupted in the middle of a run, which could either mean an error occurred before the run finished or a human-in-the-loop breakpoint was reached and the run is waiting to continue: \nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint(await client.threads.search(status=\"interrupted\",limit=1))\n\nconsole.log(await

specific threads, which you can do in a few ways:\nFind by ID\u00b6\nYou can use the get function to find the status of a specific thread, as long as you have the ID saved\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>))['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.get(<THREAD_ID>)).status);\n\ncurl --request GET \\ \n--url

filter on metadata, which can be helpful if you use metadata to tag threads in order to keep them organized:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);", "type": "Document"},

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"}], "answer": "The error you're encountering in PowerShell is due to the way quotes are handled in the command. When using ADB commands in PowerShell, you need to ensure that the quotes are properly escaped. Here\u2019s how you can correctly execute the command to check the network lock status:\n\n### Correct Command to Check Network Lock Status\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Use the following command in PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     ./adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n### Explanation\n- The command `*#7465625#` is a special code that needs to be enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes for PowerShell to interpret it correctly.\n- Make sure your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled.\n\n### Additional Steps\nIf you continue to have issues, here are some additional tips:\n\n- **Ensure ADB is Set Up Correctly**: Make sure that ADB is installed and that your device is recognized. You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential\n</document>\n<document  description='AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' title='AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' uuid='81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb'>\n### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```\n</document>\n<document  description='Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' title='Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' uuid='2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755'>\nShell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.

I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due\n</document>\n<document  description='' language='' changefreq=None source='https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/check_thread_status/' title='Check the Status of your Threads | \ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd78\ufe0fLangGraph' content_type=None lastmod='2024-12-03' priority=None loc='https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/check_thread_status/' uuid='30f5d5a1-be8a-57c3-86b0-1bad95f6932a'>\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"metadata\": {\"foo\":\"bar\"}, \"limit\": 1}' | jq -r '.[0].status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nComments\n</document>\n</documents> \n\n LLM generation: The error you're encountering in PowerShell is due to the way quotes are handled in the command. When using ADB commands in PowerShell, you need to ensure that the quotes are properly escaped. Here\u2019s how you can correctly execute the command to check the network lock status:\n\n### Correct Command to Check Network Lock Status\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Use the following command in PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     ./adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n### Explanation\n- The command `*#7465625#` is a special code that needs to be enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes for PowerShell to interpret it correctly.\n- Make sure your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled.\n\n### Additional Steps\nIf you continue to have issues, here are some additional tips:\n\n- **Ensure ADB is Set Up Correctly**: Make sure that ADB is installed and that your device is recognized. You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask!"}]}

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential\n</document>\n<document  description='AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' title='AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' uuid='81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb'>\n### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.\n\nWe will cover:\n\n- How the dialect of the LangChain [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) impacts the prompt of the chain;\n\n- How to format schema information into the prompt using `SQLDatabase.get_context`;\n\n- How to build and select [few-shot examples](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/) to assist the model.\n\n## Setup\u200b\n\nFirst, get required packages and set environment variables:\n\n```python\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\n# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```\n</document>\n<document  description='Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' title='Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' uuid='2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755'>\nShell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.

When using ADB commands in PowerShell, you need to ensure that the quotes are properly escaped. Here\u2019s how you can correctly execute the command to check the network lock status:\n\n### Correct Command to Check Network Lock Status\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Use the following command in PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     ./adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n### Explanation\n- The command `*#7465625#` is a special code that needs to be enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes for PowerShell to interpret it correctly.\n- Make sure your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled.\n\n### Additional Steps\nIf you continue to have issues, here are some additional tips:\n\n- **Ensure ADB is Set Up Correctly**: Make sure that ADB is installed and that your device is recognized. You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask!", "type": "human"}}]]}

I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself. The apps work but sometimes won't depending on the phone, not really sure why tbh, but didn't work on my phone so I used this method.\nsundar83\nsundar83\nSenior Member\nDec 6, 2011\n#6\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI.

Not required.\n# import os\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n```\n\nThe below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"}], "answer": "The error you're encountering in PowerShell is due to the way quotes are handled in the command. When using ADB commands in PowerShell, you need to ensure that the quotes are properly escaped. Here\u2019s how you can correctly execute the command to check the network lock status:\n\n### Correct Command to Check Network Lock Status\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Use the following command in PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     ./adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n### Explanation\n- The command `*#7465625#` is a special code that needs to be enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes for PowerShell to interpret it correctly.\n- Make sure your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled.\n\n### Additional Steps\nIf you continue to have issues, here are some additional tips:\n\n- **Ensure ADB is Set Up Correctly**: Make sure that ADB is installed and that your device is recognized. You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask!", "query": "PS C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools> ./adb shell \"su -c *374565625#'\"\n/system/bin/sh: no closing quote\nPS C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools>", "num_response_attempts": 1}}

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential\n</document>\n<document  description='AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' title='AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' uuid='81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb'>\n### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.\n\nWe will cover:\n\n- How the dialect of the LangChain [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) impacts the prompt of the chain;\n\n- How to format schema information into the prompt using `SQLDatabase.get_context`;\n\n- How to build and select [few-shot examples](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/) to assist the model.\n\n## Setup\u200b\n\nFirst, get required packages and set environment variables:\n\n```python\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\n# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```\n</document>\n<document  description='Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' title='Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' uuid='2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755'>\nShell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Below are the equivalent steps you can follow in PowerShell:\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Open PowerShell and type the following command to check if your phone is network locked:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use the following commands to copy `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory to your device's storage:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Ensure you keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - You will need to download a hex editor that can handle binary files. Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error.

I have no idea what fw version it is likely to have - all I know is that its brand new, white and 32gig.\n\nI took the plunge from my Desire HD so fingers crossed I will be happy with my decision to change!\n\nThanks again for your post...\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nNov 30, 2011\n#3\nNo problem. :) Glad it was a help. Thought it should be posted in his forum as well as the same method that worked for the SGS1 works for the SGS2.\nCongrats on the purchase. You'll love the phone. Have had mine for a few weeks and it's been great.\nmarcyspark\nSenior Member\nNov 30, 2011\n#4\nI have spend many hours going through XDA dev forums to prepare for the arrival of the SGS2 and I am still trying to work out what ROM to go for.\n\nI recently moved to MIUI on the Desire HD and am really enjoying the difference between this and the HTC Sense bloat. I'm hoping that the extra screen and power of the SGS2 will make me prefer this device as the Desire HD is an old but well respected bit of kit.\n\nThe SGS2 looks simple enough to root so, hopefully, over the weekend I'll get it rooted unlocked and have a rom that I can start to tinker with.\n\nThanks again!\n\n---------- Post added at 05:46 PM ---------- Previous post was at 05:44 PM ----------\n\nhttp://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=1064978&page=36\n\nIncidentally, how does your method differ from the APKs that unlock the sim on these devices?\n\ndavidheffernan\nMember\nDec 1, 2011\n#5\nRooting is very easy. Just get CF_ROOT for your firmware version. Chainfire has been making the best rooting kernels.\n\nThis method lets you do it yourself.

So, I swap mainboard and after succeed flashing of Android 7 I find out that network was locked.\nS2 Spec:\n\n1. This tread does not help me, after reboot that was no Network code asked, but always shown \"no SIM\" instead.\n2. I try this app, but it could not find any code for me.\n3. I try app from Helroz and it manage to find some code, but shown me only \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Symbols instead of the code...\n4. I found this app. And after run it was saying that it could do the job for some EUR. However at the \"Details\" of the app I find out the MCC MNC code and check it here. I find out that it was belongs to T-Mobile Austria. After google it I found this and this FAQ. Based on last one I goes to support the via Chat. The offer me unlock code for 50 EUR, but after I point to the last FAQ, they ask me to use Web Contact to solve this issue. So, I also open a ticketed via Contact here. My point was that I bought phone on Ebay few days ago and based on information in last FAQ it should be unlocked for free. I attach screenshots of the Bills copies from Ebay and PayPal. And after 1 Hour I got an Email with Code.:laugh:\n:eek:Unfortunately Phone is hanging on the \"Requesting SIM Network unlock code\" Message, seems I need to go back to stock Android first and try again...\n\nAt home a apply an old android 4.1.2 from Sammobile together with pit from here file was in \"3 parts Firmware\".\n\nBasically if you boot directly after flash you will see password enter prompt, that\"s because we are back from Android 7 to 4 and we need to boot into recovery mode and wipe everything that can be wiped under it. After this action phone will let you normally boot. During the boot I saw prompt to enter Network Lock Code. That was a time to check if it works:fingers-crossed:\nAfter I entered code - it booted and works perfectly on Android 4.:laugh:\nI will do upgrade back to the newest ROM, hope this Lock will never back.\nAlso I think that this tread solution could help if I knew about the lock before to flash it with Android 7, but only rooting instead.\nLast edited: Mar 2, 2017\nlprb99\nMember\nJun 21, 2017\n#17\nDoes this works for Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 S7275R ?\nkiva1\nkiva1\nSenior Member\nJun 21, 2017\n#18\nI just founded that this app work with S2 too, not just S1..\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxysunlock\n\nSent from my GT-I9100 using XDA Labs\nlokisyn\nSenior Member\nJul 7, 2017\n#19\nno such file found ...but i have service its crazy .....any ideas? sm-g920p sprint on boost\nagladeras\nMember\nSep 10, 2017\n#20\ncan be work on J200F ?\n1\n2\nNext\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nLink\nSimilar threads\nwestcrip\nGT-I9100 [Development] Resurrection Remix 4.4.2 KitKat v5.1.5 [2014/06/09]\nwestcrip Jan 9, 2012 4043 4044 4045\nReplies 81K\nViews 17M\nDec 8, 2020\nRocky138\n_Sale_\n[ROM][Aug 26][XWMS3] NeatROM/Lite/ExtraLite/Full/Themed/Aroma/Mods\n_Sale_ Mar 28, 2012 4491 4492 4493\nReplies 90K\nViews 11M\nFeb 6, 2021\nrickmar\ndorimanx\nLockedPoll\n[Kernel 3.12.rc6][24 OCT][DEV THREAD!] Dorimanx 8.43 ONLY JB I9100 +RECOVERY+ROOTED.\ndorimanx Apr 24, 2012 1295 1296 1297\nReplies 26K\nViews 6M\nTroubadour666\nJun 16, 2014\nTroubadour666\nLeoMar75\nLocked\n[ROM][XXLQ5][July 07]CheckROM RevoHD\u2122 V7 its True!\nLeoMar75 Oct 20, 2011 1052 1053 1054\nReplies 21K\nViews 5M\nLeoMar75\nJul 8, 2012\nLeoMar75\nPhil3759\nPoll\n[PhilZ-cwm6][i9100/P] Stock Kernel+CWM6+Root+exFAT+NTFS-MS3\nPhil3759 Sep 8, 2012 231 232 233\nReplies 5K\nViews 2M\nMay 7, 2020\nTerrorizedGakon\nForums\nSamsung\nSamsung Galaxy S II I9100\nGalaxy S II Android Development\nTop Liked Posts\n24 Hours All time\n6\ndavidheffernan\nDISCLAIMER\nNB Same info as in thread by dagentooboy for Galaxy S unlock, which I used on the two Galaxy S' I owned and two others.

Note that this process requires root access to your device.\n\n### Steps to Remove Network Lock\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Dial `*#7465625#` on your phone to check if it is network locked.\n\n2. **Backup nv_data.bin**:\n   - Use a root explorer or ADB to copy the `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 checksum from the `/efs` directory.\n   - In a terminal or ADB shell, type:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin > /sdcard/nv_data.bin\n     cat /efs/nv_data.bin.md5 > /sdcard/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - **Important**: Keep a backup of these files.\n\n3. **Edit nv_data.bin**:\n   - Open `nv_data.bin` in a hex editor.\n   - Navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if that\u2019s what you see).\n   - You should see `FF 01 00 00 00`. The first block after `FF` represents the network lock.\n   - Change the `01` to `00` to unlock the network.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file:\n     ```bash\n     su\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin\n     rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cat /sdcard/nv_data.bin > /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Restart your phone to apply the changes.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If you encounter issues, ensure that you have correctly edited the right address in the hex editor.\n- If the unlock does not work after following these steps, consider checking for any `.bak` files that may need to be deleted or ensure that your rooting method is compatible with the firmware you are using.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-ae23f623-d9b8-4147-9a78-0c4461cc3848", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about XDA Forums or the specific process for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

Open `nv_data.bin` in the hex editor and navigate to hex address `18145C` (or `181468` if applicable).\n   - Change the `01` to `00` in the first block after `FF`.\n\n4. **Replace the Edited File**:\n   - Delete the original `nv_data.bin` and its MD5 file using PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'rm /efs/nv_data.bin.md5'\"\n     ```\n   - Move the edited `nv_data.bin` back to the `/efs` directory:\n     ```powershell\n     adb push \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\edited\\nv_data.bin\" \"/efs/nv_data.bin\"\n     ```\n   - Set the correct permissions and ownership:\n     ```powershell\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     adb shell \"su -c 'chown radio.radio /efs/nv_data.bin || chown 1001.1001 /efs/nv_data.bin'\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Reboot Your Device**:\n   - Finally, reboot your phone to apply the changes:\n     ```powershell\n     adb reboot\n     ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that ADB is installed and your device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.\n- The path in the `adb push` command should be replaced with the actual path where your edited `nv_data.bin` file is located on your computer.\n- Always proceed with caution when modifying system files, as incorrect changes can lead to device malfunctions.\n\nBy following these steps in PowerShell, you should be able to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S II.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"finish_reason": "stop", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-3f8eb46e-6d04-4595-8b22-4bd726a0ec79", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

When using ADB commands in PowerShell, you need to ensure that the quotes are properly escaped. Here\u2019s how you can correctly execute the command to check the network lock status:\n\n### Correct Command to Check Network Lock Status\n\n1. **Check Network Lock Status**:\n   - Use the following command in PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     ./adb shell \"su -c '*#7465625#'\"\n     ```\n\n### Explanation\n- The command `*#7465625#` is a special code that needs to be enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes for PowerShell to interpret it correctly.\n- Make sure your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled.\n\n### Additional Steps\nIf you continue to have issues, here are some additional tips:\n\n- **Ensure ADB is Set Up Correctly**: Make sure that ADB is installed and that your device is recognized. You can check this by running:\n  ```powershell\n  ./adb devices\n  ```\n  This should list your connected device.\n\n- **Run PowerShell as Administrator**: Sometimes, running PowerShell with elevated privileges can help with permissions issues.\n\n- **Use the Correct Path**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where ADB is located, which seems to be `C:\\Users\\mildh\\downloads\\platform-tools` in your case.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to execute the command without encountering the closing quote error.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "title": "AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/", "uuid": "81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb"}, "page_content": "### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```", "type": "Document"}, {"metadata": {"description": "Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).", "language": "en", "changefreq": "weekly", "source": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "title": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain", "lastmod": null, "content_type": null, "priority": "0.5", "loc": "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/", "uuid": "2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755"}, "page_content": "Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also

<DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/<THREAD_ID> \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq -r '.status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nFind by metadata\u00b6\nThe search endpoint for threads also allows you to filter on metadata, which can be helpful if you use metadata to tag threads in order to keep them organized:\nPythonJavascriptCURL\n\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);", "type": "Document"},

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply", "type": "Document"}], "answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential\n</document>\n<document  description='AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' title='AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' uuid='81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb'>\n### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.\n\nWe will cover:\n\n- How the dialect of the LangChain [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) impacts the prompt of the chain;\n\n- How to format schema information into the prompt using `SQLDatabase.get_context`;\n\n- How to build and select [few-shot examples](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/) to assist the model.\n\n## Setup\u200b\n\nFirst, get required packages and set environment variables:\n\n```python\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\n# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith.

Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```\n</document>\n<document  description='Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' title='Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' uuid='2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755'>\nShell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.

This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself.

Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.

The latest and most popular Azure OpenAI models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/).\n\nUnless you are specifically using `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure_chat_openai/).\n\nThis page goes over how to use LangChain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).\n\nThe Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.\n\n## API configuration\u200b\n\nYou can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:\n\n```bash\n# The API version you want to use: set this to `2023-12-01-preview` for the released version.\nexport OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview\n# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com\n# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\nexport AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2023-12-01-preview\"\n```\n\n## Azure Active Directory Authentication\u200b\n\nThere are two ways you can authenticate to Azure OpenAI:\n\n- API Key\n\n- Azure Active Directory (AAD)\n\nUsing the API key is the easiest way to get started. You can find your API key in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.\n\nHowever, if you have complex security requirements - you may want to use Azure Active Directory. You can find more information on how to use AAD with Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity).\n\nIf you are developing locally, you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in. You can install the Azure CLI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Then, run `az login` to log in.\n\nAdd a role an Azure role assignment `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` scoped to your Azure OpenAI resource. This will allow you to get a token from AAD to use with Azure OpenAI. You can grant this role assignment to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. For more information about Azure OpenAI RBAC roles see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).\n\nTo use AAD in Python with LangChain, install the `azure-identity` package. Then, set `OPENAI_API_TYPE` to `azure_ad`. Next, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class to get a token from AAD by calling `get_token` as shown below. Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the token value.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\n\n# Get the Azure Credential\ncredential = DefaultAzureCredential()\n\n# Set the API type to `azure_ad`\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_TYPE\"] = \"azure_ad\"\n# Set the API_KEY to the token from the Azure credential\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = credential.get_token(\"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\").token\n```\n\nThe `DefaultAzureCredential` class is an easy way to get started with AAD authentication. You can also customize the credential chain if necessary. In the example shown below, we first try Managed Identity, then fall back to the Azure CLI. This is useful if you are running your code in Azure, but want to develop locally.\n\n```python\nfrom azure.identity import ChainedTokenCredential, ManagedIdentityCredential, AzureCliCredential\n</document>\n<document  description='AI Network is a layer 1 blockchain designed to accommodate large-scale AI models, utilizing a decentralized GPU network powered by the $AIN token, enriching AI-driven NFTs (AINFTs).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' title='AINetwork Toolkit | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ainetwork/' uuid='81a32787-6920-54ab-b277-5e83acb0d2bb'>\n### Retrieve the permissions for a path in the AINetwork Blockchain database\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Retrieve the permissions for the path /apps/{appName}.\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINownerOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m{\".owner\": {\"owners\": {\"0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\": {\"branch_owner\": true, \"write_function\": true, \"write_owner\": true, \"write_rule\": true}}}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe permissions for the path /apps/langchain_demo_0x5beb4defa2ccc274498416fd7cb34235dbc122ac are as follows:\n\n- Address: 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac\n  - branch_owner: true\n  - write_function: true\n  - write_owner: true\n  - write_rule: true\n```\n\n### Get AIN from faucet\u200b\n\n```python\n!curl http://faucet.ainetwork.ai/api/test/{address}/\n```\n\n```output\n{\"result\":\"0x0eb07b67b7d0a702cb60e865d3deafff3070d8508077ef793d69d6819fd92ea3\",\"time\":1692348112376}\n```\n\n### Get AIN Balance\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(agent.run(f\"Check AIN balance of {address}\"))\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINvalueOps` with `{'type': 'GET', 'path': '/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance'}`\n\n[0m[33;1m[1;3m100[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.[0m\n\n[1m> Finished chain.[0m\nThe AIN balance of address 0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac is 100 AIN.\n```\n\n### Transfer AIN\u200b\n\n```python\nprint(\n    agent.run(\n        \"Transfer 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```output\n\n[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m\n[32;1m[1;3m\nInvoking: `AINtransfer` with `{'address': '0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b', 'amount': 100}`\n\n[0m[36;1m[1;3m{\"tx_hash\": \"0xa59d15d23373bcc00e413ac8ba18cb016bb3bdd54058d62606aec688c6ad3d2e\", \"result\": {\"gas_amount_total\": {\"bandwidth\": {\"service\": 3}, \"state\": {\"service\": 866}}, \"gas_cost_total\": 0, \"func_results\": {\"_transfer\": {\"op_results\": {\"0\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x5BEB4Defa2ccc274498416Fd7Cb34235DbC122Ac/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}, \"1\": {\"path\": \"/accounts/0x19937B227b1b13f29e7AB18676a89EA3BDEA9C5b/balance\", \"result\": {\"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1}}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 0}}, \"code\": 0, \"bandwidth_gas_amount\": 1, \"gas_amount_charged\": 869}}[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe transfer of 100 AIN to the address 0x19937b227b1b13f29e7ab18676a89ea3bdea9c5b was successful.

We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.\n\nWe will cover:\n\n- How the dialect of the LangChain [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) impacts the prompt of the chain;\n\n- How to format schema information into the prompt using `SQLDatabase.get_context`;\n\n- How to build and select [few-shot examples](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/) to assist the model.\n\n## Setup\u200b\n\nFirst, get required packages and set environment variables:\n\n```python\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\n# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.\n# import os\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n# os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n```\n\nThe below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:\n\n- Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`\n\n- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`\n\n- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`\n\nNow, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\n\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)\nprint(db.dialect)\nprint(db.get_usable_table_names())\nprint(db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\"))\n```\n\n**API Reference:**[SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html)\n```output\nsqlite\n['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']\n[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]\n```\n\n## Dialect-specific prompting\u200b\n\nOne of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS\n\nlist(SQL_PROMPTS)\n```\n\n```output\n['crate',\n 'duckdb',\n 'googlesql',\n 'mssql',\n 'mysql',\n 'mariadb',\n 'oracle',\n 'postgresql',\n 'sqlite',\n 'clickhouse',\n 'prestodb']\n```\n\nFor example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.\n\n \nOpenAI\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n```\n\nAnthropic\n```bash\npip install -qU langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n```\n</document>\n<document  description='Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).' language='en' changefreq='weekly' source='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' title='Shell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain' lastmod=None content_type=None priority='0.5' loc='https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bash/' uuid='2f578e17-097b-57b6-9ac2-f5c0776b4755'>\nShell (bash) | \ud83e\udd9c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd17 LangChain\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Shell (bash)\n\nGiving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).\n\nThe LLM can use it to execute any shell commands.

If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.

Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due\n</document>\n<document  description='' language='' changefreq=None source='https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/check_thread_status/' title='Check the Status of your Threads | \ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd78\ufe0fLangGraph' content_type=None lastmod='2024-12-03' priority=None loc='https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/check_thread_status/' uuid='30f5d5a1-be8a-57c3-86b0-1bad95f6932a'>\nprint((await client.threads.search(metadata={\"foo\":\"bar\"},limit=1))[0]['status'])\n\nconsole.log((await client.threads.search({ metadata: { \"foo\": \"bar\" }, limit: 1 }))[0].status);\n\ncurl --request POST \\  \n--url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/threads/search \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"metadata\": {\"foo\":\"bar\"}, \"limit\": 1}' | jq -r '.[0].status'\n\nOutput:\n'idle'\n\nComments\n</document>\n</documents> \n\n LLM generation: I'm sorry, but I don't have any information related to your question about using PowerShell for unlocking a Samsung Galaxy S II.
